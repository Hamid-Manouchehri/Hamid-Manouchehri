### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a master's degree in **Mechatronics Engineering** and interested in **Robotics**, specifically control, simulation and software.
My previous experiences in this field are:
- simulation (Gazebo)
- ROS (Robot Operating System, Melodic)
- linear and nonlinear control
- inverse kinematics and dynamics
- trajectory planning
- modeling
- optimization (quadratic programming)

And my desired fields of study are:
- (mobile) manipulators
- wheeled and legged robots
- machine vision
- AI
